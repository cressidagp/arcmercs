Back in buisness. Did a new start. At the momment only Soldiers are working but their combat handlers hasn't been implemented yet.

## Introduction

ArcMercs its a NON-OFFICIAL Mercenary project for ArcEmu just for learning purposes. Its scripted in Lua but may switch to C++ eventually.

## Features

* 3 Soldiers, 1 Officer, 1 Healer.
* Database storage.
* Two hire modes: on the field (like DII) or on vendor (more fun).
* Fully customizable.

## Requirements

Its designed to be compatible with [db](https://github.com/arcemu/db) world database.

## Instalation

1. Apply all queries inside world_database in your arcemu_world database. 

2. Run all queries inside merc_database. It will create a new database called **arcmercs**.

3. Copy all lua files from arcmercs\scripts folder to arcemu\scripts folder.
